Pointer- A variable that contains the adress of another variable

One of the major changes in ANSI C is to make rules about how pointers can be manipulated.

*ip - value of the address a pointer is pointing to. (also called derefrencing)
ip-  the address of the register stored in the pointer.

(*ip)++ -increments the value stored in the cell by one
*ip++ -increments the value stored in the pointer.

&a- prints the address of the variable a.
