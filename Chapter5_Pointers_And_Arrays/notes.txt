Pointer- A variable that contains the adress of another variable

One of the major changes in ANSI C is to make rules about how pointers can be manipulated.

*ip - value of the address a pointer is pointing to. (also called derefrencing)
ip-  the address of the register stored in the pointer.

(*ip)++ -increments the value stored in the cell by one
*ip++ -increments the value stored in the pointer.

&a- prints the address of the variable a.

in an array a[i] represents *(a+i) here 'a' is the pointer which points to the first element of the array a;

so basically a = &a[0];

char a[] = "hello" -> the actual array;

a -> the pointer which points to the first element of the array a[]
when you say printf("%s\n",a)

its just printing the contents of the cell a[0] to a[strlen(a) -1]

this code prints 'h'-
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	char a[] = "hello";
	printf("%c\n",*a);
}
