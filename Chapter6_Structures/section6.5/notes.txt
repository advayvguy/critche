binary tree-

each structure(node) will have-
pointer to the text of the word
count of number of occurances
pointer to the left child node
pointer to the right child node

no node may have more than 2 children, only one or none is valid
The nodes are maintained so that at any node the left subtree contains only words that are
lexicographically less than the word at the node, and the right subtree contains only words that are
greater.

It is illegal for a structure to contain an instance of itself, but
