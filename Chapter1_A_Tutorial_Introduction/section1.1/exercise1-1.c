//Run the program hello world and leave a few parts of the program. see what errors you get and take notes of them.

#include <stdio.h> //leaving this out- it tells you that you cant use the printf function without standard input and output. pretty expected

int main() //it expects a () before {} (strange that it didnt tell me anything regarding the function not being there)

{ //ig these are called the declaration specifiers i think the sole purpose of this is to keep stuff organised 

    printf("hello world\n");
    printf("\a");
}
